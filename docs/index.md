# **Welcome to the official Project Lumina Wiki**

Project Lumina is the name of the narrative universe behind which we are developing multiple pieces of content and products. Project Lumina is an open project for everyone. Anyone can take part, provided they give credit to the creators, to the project itself, and, where applicable, to any products already developed, can make fan-made content and release it as part of the Project Lumina universe

Right now, we’re working on several [products](products.md), including a tabletop role-playing game, a series of video games, a website and a manga (that isn’t directly tied to this project).
