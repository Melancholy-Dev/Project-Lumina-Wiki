# **Project Lumina related products**

- **Seals of Lumina**: A brand-new TTRPG system we’ve written from scratch. It features an innovative manual with tools for creating characters and campaigns, complete with original Project Lumina–themed rules. Multiple editions and manuals will follow, including ready-to-play campaigns and adjustments to suit all kinds of players. We aim to release the first edition in early 2026, along with a short pre-made adventure. A limited group of beta testers will play it first, and once the core rulebook is finalized, we’ll open up the official first edition to the public. You’ll be able to download a PDF or LogSeq graph, or buy a physical copy, though the exact release date is still to be determined.

- **Lumina Aeterna**: A pixelated metroidvania RPG videogame that follows the journey of a cultist who crashes on Earth. Humanity is gone, and instead it will encounter bizarre creatures, some friendly, some not, finding himself exploring several planets. Development is currently paused so we can focus on Seals Of Lumina. Once our universe is more complete and we have the right skills and budget, we’ll resume work so the game is as enjoyable as possible. Given the scope of the idea and our team size, we don’t yet know when development will pick back up.

- **Garden 0**: An independent project created solely by [Zaffy](contributors.md), it’s a manga with an innovative pixel art style and features several characters taken from the other two products mentioned above. For more details and news, check out the official Discord server (https://discord.gg/tgg7t82D95). The manga is published in English as free to read online, and limited physical editions which are currently limited.

- **Lumina Nebulae**: A small 8-bit style game I’m personally working on. It will likely be released on Itch.io for free. The source code is publicly available on Github right now, each update is viewable and compileable for free, although at the moment no official release is available.
