It features an innovative manual with tools for creating characters and campaigns, complete with original Project Lumina\u2013themed rules. Multiple editions and manuals will follow, including ready-to-play campaigns and adjustments to suit all kinds of players. We aim to release the first edition in early 2026, along with a short pre-made adventure. A limited group of beta testers will play it first, and once the core rulebook is finalized, we\u2019ll open up the official first edition to the public.

Humanity is gone, and instead it will encounter bizarre creatures, some friendly, some not, finding himself exploring several planets. Development is currently paused so we can focus on Seals Of Lumina. Once our universe is more complete and we have the right skills and budget, we\u2019ll resume work so the game is as enjoyable as possible. Given the scope of the idea and our team size, we don\u2019t yet know when development will pick back up.</p> </li> <li> <p>Garden 0: An independent project created solely by Zaffy, it\u2019s a manga with an innovative pixel art style and features several characters taken from the other two products mentioned above.
